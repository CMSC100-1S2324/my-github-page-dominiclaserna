I am Luis Dominic B. Laserna
I am a BS Computer Science student
my Live Website link is https://cmsc100-1s2324.github.io/my-github-page-dominiclaserna/
Steps on how to create GitHub page
-a.Create a github repo and add your html and css components to it.
-b.Adjust and deploy the page from your main branch.
-c.Click the link provided by github by clicking Settings -> Pages.
I realized from this lesson that using frontend this way is better and much more fun than doing backend using react.
